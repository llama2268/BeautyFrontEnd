Hey, the zip is way too big and I dont know what how to submit the whole thing without
deleting some files or images.

Here is the github link to the repo, if that doesn't work I'll try to figure the zipping
stuff:
https://github.com/llama2268/BeautyFrontEnd

For our project to start the front end we start in dtiproject directory and
run: npm start

Then for running our backend server we go to the backend directory
and run: npm start
